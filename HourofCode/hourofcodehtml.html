<h2 class="textheader" id="thispage">Hour of Code</h2>
<hr class="paragraphlinks">   
<p class="textparagraph">The purpose of our hour of code event is to introduce the basics of computer science and programming to school children and to arouse interest in them for this field. The event was held online through the “Zoom” platform, with 6th and 7th graders of Vandam settlement ( Gabala) Secondary School No. 3 named after Elnur Bashirov on 8th of December, starting at 3 PM Baku time. The total number of participants in the event was 33.<br></p>
    
    
    <!--Second paragraph-->
    
<p class="textparagraph2">
The event began with the introduction of organizers and ADA University, moving on with a small discussion(organizers' questions and participants' opinions and responses to those questions) about computer science and programming. Then, participants were provided with an introduction and information about computer science and its fields. Followed by this, a short description of <strong>Hour of Code</strong> was presented. Next, organizers and participants moved on to the central part of the event- working on programming by blocks using “Classic Maze” Puzzles provided by the <a href="code.org">Code.org</a> website. Every new function in the tasks,  the first task was explained and completed by organizers to help participants understand the tasks clearly. Additionally, participants and the organizer team worked on and completed the next task together (organizer' screen was shared, participants' opinions of solutions were applied). After learning most of the functions, a competition was held among participants.</p>
    
    
    <!--Third Paragraph-->
    
    
<p class="textparagraph2"> 
    Each participant joined the <a href="code.org">Code.org</a> website with their accounts, and they were given 20 tasks to complete, and whoever did the most number of tasks in the given period won the 1st, 2nd ,and 3rd places correspondingly. The organizer team was following the progress of participants through the <a href="code.org">Code.org</a> website. After the competition, winners were announced by the team members. Participants, organizers, and the teacher shared their opinions about the importance of this event for students. In the end, everyone was thanked, and the event was announced to be officially over. After the event, the students who completed all 20 tasks received the official certificates of <a href="code.org">Code.org</a>. Winners of the contest got unique gifts that were purchased and sent to Gabala from Baku by the organizer team (1st place-thermos, 2nd place- mug, 3rd place-Attention strengthening set).</p>
